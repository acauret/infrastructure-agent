📁 CHECK REPOSITORY FILES:
"Show me the files in my infrastructure-agent repository"
"Get the contents of README.md from my repo"
"List all Python files in the agent folder"

🌿 CREATE BRANCH:
"Create a new branch called 'feature/ai-improvements' from master"
"Create a branch 'hotfix/bug-fix' based on the main branch"

📝 MAKE CHANGES:
"Create a new file called 'ai-notes.md' with some documentation"
"Update the README.md file to add a new section about AI features"
"Modify the requirements.txt to add a new dependency"

🔄 PULL REQUEST:

"Open a PR with title 'AI improvements' and description 'Added new AI features'"

📋 FULL WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:
------------------------
1. "Check my infrastructure-agent repository"
2. "Create a branch called 'demo/ai-workflow'"  
3. "Create a file called 'workflow-demo.md' with content about this demo"
4. "Create a pull request from demo/ai-workflow to master with title 'Demo: AI workflow automation'"

🎯 ADVANCED OPERATIONS:
