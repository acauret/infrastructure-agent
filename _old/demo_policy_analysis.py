üîí ADD SECURITY POLICY REQUEST
=============================

## Context & Scope
Repository: infrastructure-agent
Policy Type: Security & Access Control  
Impact Level: Medium

## Specific Requirements
Policy Name: "Code Quality and Security Policy"
Objective: Ensure code quality, security scanning, and proper review processes

Requirements:
- Require pull request reviews before merging to main branches
- Run automated security scans on all commits
- Require code quality checks (linting, testing)
- Block merges if security vulnerabilities found
- Require signed commits for production releases

## Analysis Instructions
Please:
1. Scan the repository structure to understand current setup
2. Search for existing GitHub workflows, security configs, and policies
3. Identify current CI/CD patterns and integration points
4. Look for existing quality gates and security measures
5. Suggest which files need modification and what new files to create

## Implementation Preferences
File Types: .yaml, .json, .md files
Naming Conventions: Follow GitHub Actions standards
Location: .github/ directory structure
Integration: With existing development workflow

## Integration Points
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Branch protection rules
- Code scanning alerts
- Pull request templates
- Developer documentation

## REPOSITORY ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Current Structure Analysis:
- Found .github/workflows/ with existing CI actions
- Located deploy/ directory with Bicep templates  
- Identified agent/ directory with Python modules
- Found existing documentation in README.md

### Existing Security Measures:
- GitHub Actions for basic CI/CD
- Environment variable management
- Azure resource deployment workflows

### RECOMMENDED CHANGES:

#### Files to Modify:
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Add security scanning steps
2. `README.md` - Add security policy documentation
3. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - Add security checklist

#### Files to Create:
1. `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Automated security scanning
2. `.github/SECURITY.md` - Security policy documentation
3. `.github/branch-protection-config.json` - Branch protection settings
4. `SECURITY_POLICY.md` - Detailed security requirements

#### Integration Strategy:
- Integrate with existing Azure CI/CD pipeline
- Add security gates to existing workflows
- Update documentation to reflect new policies
- Configure branch protection via GitHub API

### IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. High: Security scanning workflow
2. Medium: Branch protection configuration  
3. Low: Documentation updates
